# torch2otherModels(ONNX, Tensorflow, TensorflowLite)
 
This repository can be used to convert pytorch to other types of model such as ONNX, Tensorflow and TensorflowLite.

If you want to convert pytorch to TFLite, to utilize the pretrained Deep Learning model in Android, you need to follow this step:

1. Pytorch -> ONNX
2. ONNX -> Tensorflow
3. Tensorflow -> TensorflowLite
